# The compile script builds the droplet that will be run by the DEA and will 
# therefore contain all the components necessary to run the application.
#
# The script is run with two arguments, the build directory for the application
# and the cache directory, which is a location the buildpack can use to store 
# assets during the build process.
#
# During execution of this script all output sent to STDOUT will be relayed via
# CF back to the end user. The generally accepted pattern for this is to break
# out this functionality in to a 'language_pack'.
