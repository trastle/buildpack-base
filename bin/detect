# The detect script is used to determine whether or not to apply the buildpack
# to an application. The script is called with one argument, the build directory 
# for the application. It returns an exit code of 0 if the application can be 
# supported by the buildpack. If the script does return 0, it should also print 
# a framework name to STDOUT.
